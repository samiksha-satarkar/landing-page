                        <p class="answer">Cybersecurity involves protecting
                            data, systems, and networks from digital attacks. It
                            uses a combination of technology, processes, and
                            education to safeguard businesses from potential

                            cyberattack?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">Small and medium-sized businesses
                            (SMBs) are at higher risk due to limited IT
                            expertise and fewer cybersecurity resources, making
                            them easier targets for hackers compared to larger

                            businesses face?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">Staying educated on evolving
                            cyberthreats is a major challenge. Hackers often
                            trick employees into revealing their credentials,

                            cybersecurity requires ongoing education, strong

                        <p class="answer">Ransomware and phishing are top
                            concerns. Ransomware locks users out of systems
                            until a ransom is paid. Phishing involves hackers
                            gaining access to employee accounts and using them
                            to spread malware or extract valuable data.</p>
